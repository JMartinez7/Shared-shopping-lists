# Google Sign-In Logo

Since we reference a Google logo in our login screen, you'll need to add a Google logo image to your assets.

1. Download the official Google "G" logo from Google's brand resources
2. Save it as `assets/img/google_logo.png`

The login screen will fall back to a login icon if the image is not found.

Alternatively, you can use the Material Icons login icon by updating the login screen.
